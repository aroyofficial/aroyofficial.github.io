                    <p style="text-align: justify;">It was September 2021. Only 30 days were left for the famous Bengali festival 'Durgapuja'. Despite the gleesome environment around me, I was worried enough about my future. I recovered from Liver Cirrhosis just 5 months before. College
                        campusing had started on May 2021 as soon as I recovered. Thereafter I faced a lot of rejections from different companies. I got rejections from Infosys, TCS, Juspay, Maventic, Mckinley, and Rice. So I was completely mentally shattered
                        and depressed. I thought I would remain unplaced in 2021. Two weeks ago, Suddenly, a notification popped up on my mobile. I unlocked my phone and saw that a new mail was there in my Gmail inbox. After reading the mail, I came to
                        know that a company named DeltaX is coming on 10 September 2021 and they are going to carry out the whole recruitment process in a single day. I thought I would get rejection again. That is why I did not take it seriously. Finally,
                        10 September came. TPO told us that this recruitment process would be carried out in 3 rounds. The first is the Technical Aptitude round, the second one is the Coding round, and the third one is the Technical Interview. At 12 PM
                        the first round was started. The first round had 50 questions on C, C++, and Data Structures. We had to solve that within 45 minutes. Now, I have a strong base on C programming language, object-oriented approach, and data structures.
                        It helped me to answer 42 questions out of 50 within 45 minutes. After the first round, I was gone to take bath. While bathing, I was thinking that there should be a chance to get selected in the second round because I had answered
                        almost 90% questions correctly. After taking bath, I took my lunch. Suddenly, my phone ring became loud. From the other side of the phone, TPO said to me that I had been selected for the second round and the second round would
                        start at 2.30 PM. After hearing the news, I had a neutral reaction. Because I thought, this second round was the last round for me. In the second round, there were 5 programming problems and the time limit was 2 hours. I am a Pythonista
                        since my second year of college. That is why I had chosen python to solve the programming problems. The First 2 problems were easy and I was able to solve them within the first 30 minutes. But the tensions were building from the
                        third problem. After a lot of thinking, finally, the third and fourth problems were solved. Still, one problem remained and only 20 minutes were left. I tried so hard, but I could not solve it fully. After the coding round, I thought
                        one had to do 5 out of 5. Then only he or she would get a chance in the technical interview. So, I had no hope of getting selected in the interview round. After taking the coding assessment I went to the gym and returned home around
                        6.00 PM. It was a normal evening like other evenings. But a phone call was going to make that evening special. Around 6.30 PM my phone sprang. I saw an incoming call on my phone. According to truecaller, it was showing the location
                        as Bangalore. I received the call. On the other side, there was a female voice. She said, "Congratulations Arijit! I am from DeltaX. You've been selected for the interview round. Your interview round starts at 6.45 PM. Please find
                        the Google Meet link sent to your email and join in 10 minutes. All the best." As soon as she drops the call, no more words were coming out of my mouth. An immense joy engulfed me. I was going to give a job interview for the first
                        time in my life! Along with that, I thought, they will reject me 200 percent. Because I have no prior experience in interviews as well as my communication skills are weak and I have zero preparation. I dressed up quickly and turn
                        on my laptop and entered into the meeting around 6.40 PM. The interview started with an introduction. The interviewer turned on his camera and introduced himself. Thereafter I also introduced myself. Then he opened that Hackerrank
                        Coding assessment and told me to explain all the four problems which I had done. I was successful to explain all the problems to him. Then he asked me to do the fifth problem which I could not solve fully. It took almost 20 minutes
                        to solve that problem. He checked it and asked me to explain the approach to the solution. I explained the approach and he was satisfied with the explanation. Then he asked me about my project. I told him about the project in a
                        nutshell, including the future scope of the project. I realized he was not satisfied with the project. I knew it was my fault because due to my poor communication skill I was unable to explain the project in a good manner. Then
                        he gave me a problem to print a two-dimensional matrix spirally. Now, this problem was new to me. I thought I could not solve it. But my mind said to me, try it once. So, firstly I thought about the logic and then I started implementing
                        it in Python. It took around 30 minutes to implement that problem successfully. Sometimes I wonder, how I solved that unknown problem that day. I think this is the power of the mind. If you have a good base of knowledge in a domain,
                        and a strong mindset - then you can solve any problem in that domain. Now, the interviewer was astonished! Because looking at my facial expression he thought I could not solve this problem. Thereafter, I explained the approach
                        to him and it was absolutely correct. Now he asked me a question. The question was - if this matrix is an n by n matrix then what is the index of the last element visited by the spiral traversal? Now, mathematics was one of my
                        favorites. I instantly answered the question within 5 seconds. After that, he was really impressed. He also praised me by saying, "Arijit, you have really good aptitude skills!". Already, 2 hours passed since the interview started.
                        Sometimes he put me in a stew situation. But I was confident about what I know. So, I confidently answered the questions. Finally, he told me to design an object-oriented template for The Spotify app. He just told me to write the
                        method names, classes, and interfaces. While I am writing this template; he said, "Okay Arijit. I am done with your interview. If you have any questions then you can ask." Then I asked him about my feedback. He again praised me
                        for my aptitude skills as well as he described how DeltaX works and what are the technology stack used in the organization. After telling all these, he said the last words. I will not forget his last words throughout my life. He
                        said to me, "Okay Arijit. Welcome to DeltaX and HR will share the updates with you."; and then he ended the interview. When I left the room; it was 9.10 PM. This means I gave an interview of 2 hours and 30 minutes. I was extremely
                        happy that night. I share my first interview experience with my parents. They are also overjoyed. I also told them about the feedback of the interviewer which indicates, that there is a high chance to be selected in DeltaX. When
                        I turned on my phone, I saw several missed calls from my college friends as well as from our TPO. I talked to each of them and shared my experience. Everybody was astonished after knowing the interview duration. Everybody who heard
                        about this interview experience, said to me - your selection is just a matter of time. At last, that golden day came in my life. 15 September 2021. Around 11:35 I got a call from our TPO. He congratulated me for being placed in
                        DeltaX. He told me to check my mail. I opened my Gmail and saw I have received a mail from DeltaX HR along with my offer letter. My mom welled up with tears of joy after hearing the news. She called my father and other relatives
                        to tell them the good news. One thing I realized that day, hard work will definitely pay you back one day. This first success gave me more energy to crack the other job opportunities in the next 6 months. Already I sat in more
                        than 25 interviews. But, the point to be noted, it was the toughest interview ever in my life. I still don't know how I succeeded that day despite zero preparation. I think the common sense and my 'learn to know' behavior made
                        me successful that day. So, this was the story of my first interview. If you like this blog then you can give me feedback through the form given below. See you soon in the next blog. Have a nice day.</p>
