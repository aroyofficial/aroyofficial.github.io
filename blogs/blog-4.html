                    <p style="text-align: justify;">CV stands for Curriculum Vitae. A CV is a detailed document highlighting your professional and academic history. CVs typically include work experience, achievements and awards, scholarships or grants youâ€™ve earned, coursework, research
                        projects, and publications of your work. As a fresher or experienced, you have to submit your CV to the recruiter. A well-designed and organized CV makes a good impression of you on the recruiter's mind. Also, high-quality writing
                        communicates your strengths and skills with ease. Now, let's see how to design a good CV. If you need help determining how to write a CV, it can be helpful to consult a template. The best way to design your CV through a template
                        is Canva. Canva is a web application used for graphic designing, poster designing, etc. I recommend everyone to create an account in Canva. Canva has a lot of features for designing. Once you have an account you will come to know
                        about the features. You can search for CV templates in Canva and you will find a lot of free templates. You can choose any of them and start designing according to your needs. When you are done with the design; you can download
                        your CV in any format from the download option. Now, let's know what are the things to include in your CV. So, first of all, you have to include a header section in your CV. This header section consists of your name, photo, and
                        contact details (it includes address, contact no., portfolio link(if available), LinkedIn profile link, etc.). After completion of the header section, include an objective section. Here you should write about yourself, your passion,
                        and the job position for which you are applying. The objective section should not exceed 50 to 60 words. Now start writing the educational qualification section. Include Secondary, Higher Secondary, and degree courses. Include
                        education institution name, affiliation, year of passing, and marks percentage for each qualification. Now, start writing about your Technical Skills (like programming languages, databases, frontend frameworks, backend frameworks,
                        core concepts, etc.). Now you can include projects and research publication section (if you have). While writing about the projects - mention the project name, your role in the project, your project domain, and from where you've
                        done the project. Additionally, you can add the certifications and awards section (if you have). Only include those certifications which are nationally or globally acceptable certificates. Add 2 to 4 important certifications. As
                        a fresher, if you don't have any certifications - then it's okay. At last, include your personal details like DOB, Marital Status, hobbies, languages, etc. Finally, add a declaration section at the bottom of your CV. The Declaration
                        section consists of a short paragraph; where you are declaring that all the information given above is true. Don't forget to add the place name and your e-signature at the end of the declaration section. If you are going to create
                        your CV by following the above steps; then I can assure you - it will stand out you from the other applicants. I recommend some special CV templates available in Canva. You can find it by clicking the button given below. Just copy
                        the template into your account and start building your CV. While reading this blog, if you are a final year student - then immediately create your CV, because your campusing is going to be started soon. If you are a first, second,
                        or third-year student then start making your CV, because your CV may be needed in internships. Also, updation of the CV is needed over time. So keep it in your mind. With that, here I am ending this week's blog. We will meet soon
                        in the next week with a new blog. Have a good day. Stay happy, stay healthy, and best wishes for your academic and professional career.
