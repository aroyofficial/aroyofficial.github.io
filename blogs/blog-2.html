                    <h3 class="major">Are you a beginner?</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">As a beginner, it is not easy to learn programming. I know how it feels! When I came into the Computer Science stream; I was from Biological Science background. Even I don't know that C is a programming language. I know at that time
                        that C is an alphabet. It sounds like a joke to you, right? But it is true. To master the programming, what you need is a roadmap along with learning and practicing on a daily basis. So, as a beginner, first, you have to learn
                        about Boolean logic, Number representation in different number systems, arithmetic operations on them, logic gates, concept of hardware, software and basic layout of a computer. Then you are good to go. Now, you can start your
                        programming journey according to the roadmap given below.</p>
                    <h3 class="major">Are you an intermediate?</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have good basics on Programming then it's awesome. If you know the basics of C, C++, or Java; you are ready to upgrade yourself. For advanced topics, you can check the roadmap given below. Along with it, start learning Datastructures
                        and Algorithms. DSA is the most important topic in the stream of Computer Science. DSA is the set of logic behind the real-life implementation of software.</p>
                    <h3 class="major">Which programming language you should learn?</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are lots of programming languages like C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, etc. According to a recent report, there are almost 9000 different programming languages! So, which one you should learn? Obviously, there is no one
                        who knows all the programming languages. Even no one knows all the features of a single programming language. Now come to the main point. Different programming languages are designed on the basis of different approaches. The official
                        term for the 'programming approach' is known as 'Paradigm'. Now, there are mainly 3 programming paradigms which should be known to a programmer. The first is the procedural programming paradigm. A beginner should start with the
                        procedural programming paradigm. C programming language follows procedural programming paradigm - where a program is subdivided into procedures or functions. So, a beginner must start his programming journey with C programming
                        or you may start with other procedural programming languages like Python, etc. When you have a good base on the procedural approach then you can start with Object-Oriented approach. In the Object-Oriented approach, a program consists
                        of Classes and Objects. You can start learning OOP with C++ or Java or Python or C# or JavaScript. Along with it now you can start learning Database programming languages like SQL (Structured Query Language). So, these 3 programming
                        paradigms and their concepts are the base of a programmer. Also, note this point - A programming language does not follow a single paradigm. It may follow multiple paradigms. Like Python, C++ are multiparadigm languages. They follow
                        both procedural and object oriented paradigm.</p>
                    <h3 class="major">Roadmap to Procedural approach</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">As a beginner when you are going to start learning the Procedural approach, I recommended to start with C. Let us divide the C programming into 3 parts. First of all 'basics'. The basics consist of - operators, data types, taking input,
                        printing output, decision making statements, iterative statements, jump statements, typecasting, function, and recursion. While learning the basics, you can try different problems like - leap year checking, vowel checking, armstrong
                        number checking, palindrome number checking, finding the sum and product of digits of a number, finding sum of a series, LCM and GCD finding, etc. After dealing with the basics you can move to the 'intermediate'. The intermediate
                        consist of - Storage class, Non-primitive data types, pointer, string, dynamic memory allocation, and Command-line Arguments. While learning the intermediate you can start implementing different data structures, like - stack, queue,
                        linked list, tree, matrix manipulation problems, string manipulation problems, BFS, DFS, etc. Now, it's enough to complete up to intermediate. But if you want to know more then you can move to the 'advanced' section. The advanced
                        section includes - I/O handling, header file creation, Memory management in C, other libraries, etc. Click the button below to see the complete roadmap.</p>
                    <ul class="actions">
                        <li><a class="button" href="https://bit.ly/3wV2vZR" target="_blank">C Programming Roadmap</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="major">Roadmap to Object-Oriented approach</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">This is the most important topic in this whole blog. When you're going to sit in the recruitment drives, they will surely ask you questions related to the object-oriented approach. So, as a fresher, you must know OOP concepts and at
                        least one popular OOP language like C++, or Java. Now, honestly saying OOP is a very vast topic. As a beginner to OOP, we have to learn only a limited portion. I've prepared a smooth roadmap to learn OOP with Java from scratch.
                        You can find it by clicking the button given below. If you're a C++ programmer then it's fine. As the concepts are similar, as a C++ programmer you can practice the same.</p>
                    <ul class="actions">
                        <li><a class="button" href="https://bit.ly/3t6GtCp" target="_blank">OOP Roadmap</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="major">Roadmap to SQL</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Writing SQL to handle a database is much easier than writing C or Java. You can learn SQL within 2 weeks. The syntax of SQL is very easy and understandable. Lots of companies ask questions or queries related to SQL in their technical
                        interviews as well as in the technical aptitude round. So, you must practice complex queries like joining 3 or 4 or more tables, multiple nested queries, etc. You can click the button given below to check how to go from basic to
                        advanced concepts in SQL. You can practice queries in any DBMS like MySQL, MSSQL, SQLite, Oracle, etc.</p>
                    <ul class="actions">
                        <li><a class="button" href="https://bit.ly/3N0ipJv" target="_blank">SQL Roadmap</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="major">Roadmap to DSA</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Datastructures and Algorithms is a sea. There are lots of data structures available. You don't need to know them all. You've to know Stack, Queue, Linked List, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Heap, and Hash Table. That's enough. Now
                        coming to the algorithms - searching and sorting are very important. These algorithms are required in almost every problem which you're going to solve. In searching algorithm - you need to learn linear search and binary search.
                        In sorting algorithms you need to learn - selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, quick sort, and merge sort. Additionally, radix sort and bucket sort are important for competitive programming. Also, you need to learn Graph
                        traversal, and tree traversal algorithms which are one of the most important algorithms. You need to know Divide and Conquer, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, and Backtracking approach and the problems related to them. If you can learn
                        these things in DSA; then you can assure that you have a strong base in DSA. Though if you need a separate blog on DSA then message me through the contact form given below.</p>
                    <h3 class="major">How much time you have?</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Are you a 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> year student?</b><br />I know you have less time on your hand. I think you have some basic concepts of Programming, SQL, and DSA. So, all you need is to brush up the previous
                                    things. Along with it start practicing the DSA problems. Only Stack, Queue, Linked List, and basic and intermediate concepts of object-oriented and procedural programming are needed for normal company interviews. But
                                    if you want to move into product-based companies then you need to master the graph, tree data structures, and advanced concepts as well.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Are you a 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> year student?</b><br />
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">This is the right time. Start learning from today and you can see the change after 1 to 2 years. This blog is specially for the beginners like you.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Are you a class XI or XII student?</b><br />
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">Are you from class XI or XII? Are you planning to come into the Computer Science stream? You're so lucky that you find this blog. If you start learning this roadmap today at your own pace then you can see the change when
                                    you will be in the third or fourth year of college.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="major">Practice, Practice, and Practice</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">"Practice makes a man perfect" - you know it, right? So, all you need is to practice on a daily basis. Remember, continuous learning is necessary. It's not like you're learning 14 hours a day and then again you'll start learning after
                        3 to 4 days. Continuous effort, hard work, and the execution of this roadmap will turn you into an absolute programmer. So, take a deep breath and start your journey from today.</p>
                    <h3 class="major">Footnote</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hey, are you tired of reading this blog? are you still wondering; how much time it will take to master these concepts? I have only one answer to this question. Continuous learning is needed. Then one day you can feel the change within
                        you. I don't know which day, but one day - it may be after 6 to 8 months, it may be after 1 year or 1 and half years. So, start your journey from today and keep believing in yourself. I wish you all the best for your future. If
                        you have any questions or feedback regarding this blog then you can message me through the contact form given below. Wish you a good day ahead.</p>
